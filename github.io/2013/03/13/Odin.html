<p>My son’s name is Odin. We normally use the Old Norse spelling of Óðinn.<br />
When we say his name, though, we just say Odin (<em>Oh-den</em>), but a lot of people ask about the Norse spelling.<br />
Ó is said the same as if you were to exclaim <em>Oh!</em>.<br />
Ðð is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%90">eth</a> and is said <em>th</em> as in fa <em>th</em> er.<br />
Putting it all together, you would say Óðinn as <em>Oh-then</em>.<br />
You can hear a computer say it <a href="http://translate.google.com/#en/is/Odin">on Google Translate</a>.</p>
