  <h1 class="post">The Smiths</h1>
<div class="box">
  <p>When I was about 14 I started listening to metal and punk almost exclusively. The loud, sloppy, noisy, and angry kind. The stuff that sounds good when you are a kid and parents just don&#39;t understand. Since I was a certified poseur I also read all of the rock and punk magazines that I could get my hands on. Despite my South Carolina public school education I was able to read the interviews and could even glean common points that the musicians would bring up. There were bands that would be mentioned as influences and, even though I didn&#39;t know them, I could at least name drop and pretend that their first album was good. At some point I noticed that a lot of the punk bands mentioned some band called The Smiths. I had no idea who they were, but if all of these cool punk guys like them, then surely they must be punk as fuck.<br>
Since this was the late 90s I went to a thing called a record store. I went to my old familiar punk section and recited the alphabet quietly to myself and found the S section. And then the SMs. But where The Smiths should have been, they were not. After repeating the alphabet several times and making quite certain that I had it right I decided they might be a metal band after all. No. Not in metal. I took a deep breath and went and found the guy who works in the record store really hoping that he wouldn&#39;t murder me for not knowing where The Smiths are categorised.<br>
I explained that I wanted to buy a CD of The Smiths, but I couldn&#39;t find it for some reason. He was only a little snarky and dragged me past the metal section, past the punk, and right over to the section that I had never allowed myself to get close to... POP. I thought &quot;What is going on here? This can&#39;t be right.&quot;, but alas. There was the plastic divider clearly labelled The Smiths. He then said &quot;Do you know what you want?&quot; and I confessed that I didn&#39;t know them. He handed me &#39;Meat Is Murder&#39; and said &quot;I like this one.&quot; If you don&#39;t know the album, the cover has a soldier with &#39;Meat Is Murder&#39; handwritten on his helmet. Looked punk enough. Maybe it was in pop because they were older? I didn&#39;t know, but I did know I was about to have an experience once I got home-- my car only had an AM/FM radio.<br>
As soon as I arrived home I took the plastic off the case and put it in my CD player. I distinctly remember waiting for a second before hitting play. From the first note in <em>The Headmaster Ritual</em> I was sure there was some mistake. There was another band called The Smiths. They were underground and even the best record store in Columbia didn&#39;t have them in stock.  Whatever The Smiths were, this was not them. Of that much I could be sure.  </p>
