  <h1 class="post">You Died</h1>
<div class="box">
  <p>You were on your way home when you died.  </p>

<p>It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. you left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s when you met me.  </p>

<p>&quot;What.. what happened?&quot; you asked. &quot;Where am I?&quot;<br>
&quot;You died,&quot; I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.  </p>

<p>&quot;There was a.. a truck and it was skidding...&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Yup,&quot; I said.  </p>

<p>&quot;I... I died?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Yup. But don&#39;t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,&quot; I said.  </p>

<p>You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. &quot;What is this place?&quot; you asked. &quot;Is this the afterlife?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;More or less,&quot; I said.  </p>

<p>&quot;Are you god?&quot; you asked.  </p>

<p>&quot;Yup,&quot; I replied. &quot;I&#39;m god.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;My kids... my wife,&quot; you said.<br>
&quot;What about them?&quot;<br>
&quot;Will they be all right?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s what I like to see,&quot; I said. &quot;You just died and your main concern is for your family. That&#39;s good stuff right there.&quot;  </p>

<p>You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn&#39;t look like god. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.  </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; I said. &quot;They&#39;ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn&#39;t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it&#39;s any consolation, she&#39;ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; you said. &quot;So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Neither,&quot; I said. &quot;You&#39;ll be reincarnated.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; you said. &quot;So the Hindus were right,&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;All religions are right in their own way,&quot; I said.<br>
&quot;Walk with me.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;You followed along as we strode through the void.<br>
&quot;Where are we going?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Nowhere in particular,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s just nice to walk while we talk.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;So, what&#39;s the point, then?&quot; You asked. &quot;When I get reborn, I&#39;ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won&#39;t matter.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Not so!&quot; I said. &quot;You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of your past lives. You just don&#39;t remember them right now.&quot;  </p>

<p>I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders.<br>
&quot;Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic that you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of waht you are. It&#39;s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it&#39;s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself in the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you&#39;ve gained all the experiences it had.  </p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven&#39;t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you&#39;d start remembering everything. But there&#39;s no point to doing that between each life.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;How many times have I been reincarnated, then?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Oh lots. Lots and lots. And in to lots and lots of different lives.&quot; I said. &quot;This time around, you&#39;ll be in a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Wait, what?&quot; you stammered. &quot;You&#39;re sending me back in time?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Well, technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Where you come from?&quot; you said.<br>
&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; I explained &quot;I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you&#39;ll want to know what it&#39;s like there, but honestly you wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; you said, a little let down. &quot;But, wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s happening.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;So, what&#39;s the point of it all?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Seriously?&quot; I asked. &quot;Seriously? You&#39;re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn&#39;t that a little stereotypical?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s a reasonable question,&quot; you persisted.  </p>

<p>I looked you in the eye. &quot;The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;You mean mankind? You want us to mature?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;There is no one else,&quot; I said. &quot;In this universe, there&#39;s just you and me.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;You stared blankly at me. &quot;But all the people on earth...&quot;<br>
&quot;All you. Different incarnations of you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Wait. I&#39;m everyone!?&quot;<br>
&quot;Now you&#39;re getting it,&quot; I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m every human being who ever lived?&quot;<br>
&quot;Or who will ever live, yes.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Abraham Lincoln?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Hitler?&quot; you said, appalled.<br>
&quot;And you&#39;re the millions he killed.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m Jesus?&quot;<br>
&quot;And you&#39;re everyone who followed him.&quot;  </p>

<p>You fell silent.  </p>

<p>&quot;Every time you victimised someone,&quot; I said, &quot;you were victimising yourself. Every act of kindness you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.&quot;  </p>

<p>You thought or a long time.  </p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; you asked me. &quot;Why do all this?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Because someday, you will become like me. Because that&#39;s what you are. You&#39;re one of my kind. You&#39;re my child.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Whoa,&quot; you said, incredulous. &quot;You mean I&#39;m a god?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, not yet. You&#39;re a fetus. You&#39;re still growing. Once you&#39;ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;So the whole universe,&quot; you said, &quot;it&#39;s just...&quot;<br>
&quot;An egg.&quot; I answered. &quot;Now it&#39;s time for you to move on to your next life.&quot;  </p>

<p>And I sent you on your way.  </p>
