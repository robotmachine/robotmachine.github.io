{"name":"ql","tagline":"Quick Ledger entry","body":"# ql\r\n### Quick entry creation tool for [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/ \"Ledger\").  \r\n\r\n#### Install\r\n1. Download and extract the archive\r\n2. Move `ql` to `/usr/local/bin` or somewhere in your `$PATH`\r\n3. Run `chmod +x ql`\r\n  \r\n#### Usage\r\nThe first time you run `ql` it will try to figure out where your Ledger data file is located based on `$LEDGER` and `$LEDGER_FILE` environment variables and store this in a ~/.qlrc file. If nothing is found, it will just ask you.  \r\n```\r\nusage: ql [-h] [-f LEDGER_FILE] [-a ACCOUNT] [-m MERCHANT] [-c CATEGORY]\r\n          [-e EXPENSE] [-t AMOUNT] [-s] [-x] [--list] [--set-acct]\r\n          [--set-merch] [--set-cat] [--config ALT_CONFIG]\r\n\r\nql: Quick `ledger' entry creation tool.\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -f LEDGER_FILE, --file LEDGER_FILE\r\n                        Specify Ledger file.\r\n  -a ACCOUNT, --account ACCOUNT\r\n                        Specify account from ql's configuration file.\r\n  -m MERCHANT, --merchant MERCHANT\r\n                        Set merchant.\r\n  -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY\r\n                        Set category.\r\n  -e EXPENSE, --expense EXPENSE\r\n                        Set category. Automatically prepends Expenses:\r\n  -t AMOUNT, --amount AMOUNT\r\n                        Set dollar amount.\r\n  -s, --split           Split payment.\r\n  -x, --not-cleared     Marks transaction as not cleared.\r\n  --list                List details from .qlrc\r\n  --set-acct            Set up accounts in config file.\r\n  --set-merch           Set up merchants in config file.\r\n  --set-cat             Set up categories in config file.\r\n  --config ALT_CONFIG   Specify alternate config file.\r\n```\r\n  \r\n#### Configuration File  \r\n`ql` keeps all data in `$HOME/.qlrc`  \r\nHere is a sample of what one might look like:  \r\n`$> cat ~/.qlrc`  \r\n  \r\n```\r\n[file]  \r\nledger_file = /home/robotmachine/doc/Ledger.dat  \r\n  \r\n[account]\r\ndefault_account = CHEQ \r\nCHEQ = Assets:MyBank:Chequing  \r\nSAVE = Assets:MyBank:Savings  \r\n  \r\n[merchant]  \r\nSD = Sundance Natural Foods  \r\nSQ = SeQUential Biofuels  \r\n\r\n[category]\r\ngroc = Expenses:Groceries\r\nSD = Expenses:Groceries  \r\nSQ = Expenses:Auto:Fuel  \r\n```\r\nThe ~/.qlrc file can be manually edited or you can use the various setup options, --set-acct, --set-cat, --set-merch to have `ql` add them to ~/.qlrc for you.  \r\n  \r\n#### Usage Continued\r\nWhen using the `ql -a ACCOUNT` option, `ql` will attempt to match the entry with one of the accounts in the [account] section of ~/.qlrc If a match is not found, the literal string will be used.  \r\n  \r\nThe same is true of the `ql -m MERCHANT` option. If a match is found for the merchant and the same entry is present under [category], then the category will be used. If that does not match, then it will prompt interactively for an expense category.  \r\n  \r\nThe -s/--split option will take the -t amount as the total (or prompt for one) and prompt through splitting the transaction between multiple categories (see example). `ql` does its best to make sure the transaction will balance and will add the total as a negative balance which will cause an error in `Ledger` if the amounts do not reconcile. Entering a 0 for any of the splits will use the remainder of the balance.  \r\n  \r\nThe -x/--not-cleared option will use a ! instead of * between the date and the merchant as per the `Ledger` documentation to mark the transaction as not cleared. Please see `Ledger` documentation on how this works. Note: You will need to manually edit your ledger.dat file to mark it as cleared. Re-running `ql` without the -x will not mark the transaction as cleared-- it will only add an additional entry for the same amount.  \r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\nEveryone loves examples. The above .qlrc file is assumed for the examples.  \r\n  \r\n`ql -m SD -t 27.50` will append the following to /home/robotmachine/doc/Ledger.dat  \r\n```\r\n2014-11-01 * Sundance Natural Foods  \r\n\tExpenses:Groceries\t\t$27.50  \r\n\tAssets:MyBank:Chequing  \r\n```\r\n##### Split Transaction\r\n`ql -m SD -t 100`\r\n```\r\nTotal is $100.00  \r\nEnter '0' for the remainder.  \r\n  \r\nEnter amount for split number 1:        $75  \r\nEnter category for split number 1:      Expenses:Expenses:Groceries  \r\n  \r\n$25.00 remaining.  \r\nEnter amount for split number 2:        $0  \r\nEnter category for split number 2:      Expenses:Heathcare:Supplements  \r\n  \r\nWrote entry to /home/robotmachine/doc/Ledger.dat:  \r\n2014-12-27 * Sundance Natural Foods \r\n        Expenses:Heathcare:Supplements  $25.00    \r\n        Expenses:Groceries              $75.00  \r\n        Assets:MyBank:Chequing          $-100.00  \r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
