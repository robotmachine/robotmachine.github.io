<div class="box">
  <p>Many years ago back when i was in university, i used to live with these two guys: Chad was working in a brew-your-own-beer establishment and Eric was a slacker who was staying on our couch for an extended period of time.  </p>

<p>Chad had a little ritual when he got up for work every morning. After washing up, he would grab a seat right beside our sleeping guest in the livingroom. He would spend the next half an hour drinking coffee, brewing himself bottle tokes and whispering into Eric&#39;s ear over and over and over:  </p>

<p>&quot;Kill the mayor. Kill the mayor, Eric. Eric, kill the mayor. Eric! Kill the mayor!&quot;  </p>

<p>This continued for a period of months until one day Eric and I were walking home from a trip downtown. Passing in front of City Hall, Eric suddenly came to a stop with a perplexed look on his face.  </p>

<p>&quot;Eric, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; I asked.  </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; he replied. &quot;Something about the mayor&quot;  </p>
